# SAN-Website
Smart Area Network

SAN is a web-based application built on a Map framework that utilizes features such as navigation, voice assistance, and markers through APIs. The system has separate databases for each domain of service and integrates multidisciplinary services together. Users can access food ordering, movie ticket booking, and various other details such as public places, government offices, clinics, all within the same user interface. It also helps small businesses, such as small shops, connect with people in the same area. The system uses various algorithms such as A-star algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and a Text-To-Speech algorithm which are implemented through APIs.
